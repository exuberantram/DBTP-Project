# DBTP-Project
## This project is meant to test a lot of basic skills as I combine them and grow them into a larger project. 

## What the project currently does:

### Next Steps: 
```
- Separate the JavaScript from the HTML into its own file
- Add a secondary static Div that the moveable Div can go over
- Add bounds for the moveable Div to keep it in a certain area
- Project a copy of the static Div below the bounds of the moveable Div
```

# DBTP-Project
## This project is meant to test a lot of basic skills as I combine them and grow them into a larger project. 

## What the project currently does: 
![Gif Showing a Div box with a blue header being clicked on and dragged by the mouse](https://github.com/exuberantram/DBTP-Project/blob/master/DBTP_move.gif)

### Next Steps: 
```
- Add bounds for the moveable Div to keep it in a certain area
- Project a copy of the static Div below the bounds of the moveable Div
- Create a clipping effect of the moveable Div over the Static Div
- Project the negative shape created by the moveable div and the Static div to below the bounds of the moveable Div
```
